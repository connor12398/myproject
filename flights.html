	<h1> Flights and Planning </h1>
	<p> All flights must be planned ahead with our company by calling the serrvice number or e-mail. Flights can be made to and from the dstination.
    Flight time may vary depending on the chosen airline. It is recommended that vistors pre-plan their tours with an advisor before the flight of their arrival.
    Flight costs will be covered seperately from the tourism costs. When a customer selects a tour to a city to visit, they may pick one destination, two, or all three together. The triple city visit to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Vladivostok is by far the most popular. </p>

	<h2> Flight Offers</h2>
